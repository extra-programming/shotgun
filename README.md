#Shotgun Sequencing!

---
###Description:
A project to sequence DNA

---
###Goals:
####Completed:
* Start stuff
* Create a README


####Short Term Plans:
* Make DNA to sequence
* Make tests
* Think about animating (at least the recombining of long sequences), probably color-coded. Maybe long matching sequences would get highlighted before being dragged together. Maybe we can learn from the [animated sorters](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Animations_of_sort_algorithms) . Note: google search [shotgun sequencing animation] (http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=shotgun+sequencing+animation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) finds many potential videos and tutorials.


####Long Term Plans:
* Sequence the DNA
* Read about [Jim Kent's GigAssembler](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC311095/)
* Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_sequencing
* NASA's code standards (when life depends upon it) http://pixelscommander.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/P10.pdf
