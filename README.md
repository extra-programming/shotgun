#Shotgun Sequencing!

---
###Description:
A project to sequence DNA

---
###Goals:
####Completed:
* Start project
* Create a README
* Create DNA to sequnence

####In Progress:
* Fake the process of cutting-up and sequencing short strips of DNA
  * The sequencing error rate should be significantly higher near the ends of the segments
* Make tests
  *  How do we test random stuff? [This article](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTestingRandomness) looks like a good place to start...

####Short Term Plans:
* Think about animating (at least the recombining of long sequences), probably color-coded. Maybe long matching sequences would get highlighted before being dragged together. Maybe we can learn from the [animated sorters](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Animations_of_sort_algorithms). Note: google search [shotgun sequencing animation](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=shotgun+sequencing+animation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) finds many potential videos and tutorials.


####Long Term Plans:
* Re-assemble the sequenced genome

* NASA's code standards (when life depends upon it) http://pixelscommander.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/P10.pdf
* All kinds of [interactive animated algorithms] (http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html) (Flash and Java), including stacks, queues, binary search trees, sorters, etc. Better than the wikipedia animations because we can control speed, step forward &amp; backward, etc.  http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html
  * Add this link to wikipedia if it is not there!
